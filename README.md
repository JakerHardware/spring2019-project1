# Project 1
###### By: Jacob Huebner - ITMD 362 Spring 2019 

You will create a single-page design that features a sign-up process to get new users to join some type of project, such as an email list, a software beta test, or an open-source community. The goal of this project is to experiment with patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is youâ€™re offering, which is not at all an easy task.

## Goals

* Create a mobile-first responsive web design using two media queries
* Apply design principles including typography, color, and material design
* Engage in agile, iterative development; documented with at least 20 commits with informative comments

* The URL to your GitHub repository, and the URL to your Github Pages live link
* Screen shot of your html and css validations
* Two questions eliciting feedback on from fellow students

2. [x] **Second Deliverable:** Give constructive comments to help at least three other students.

* Post a screen shot of your three comments to the comments folder in your personal Basecamp folder.
