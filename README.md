# Project 1
###### By: Jacob Huebner - ITMD 362 Spring 2019 

You will create a single-page design that features a sign-up process to get new users to join some type of project, such as an email list, a software beta test, or an open-source community. The goal of this project is to experiment with patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is you’re offering, which is not at all an easy task.

## Goals

* Create a mobile-first responsive web design using two media queries
* Apply design principles including typography, color, and material design
* Engage in agile, iterative development; documented with at least 20 commits with informative comments

## Deliverables & Milestones


1. [x] **First Deliverable:** Create a Basecamp post describing your work in progress. Title the post with your name and project number (example Daniel Krieglstein: Project 1). Your post should include:

* The URL to your GitHub repository, and the URL to your Github Pages live link
* Screen shot of your html and css validations
* Two questions eliciting feedback on from fellow students

2. [ ] **Second Deliverable:** Give constructive comments to help at least three other students.

* Post a screen shot of your three comments to the comments folder in your personal Basecamp folder.

3. [ ] **Third Deliverable:** You will receive a list on your Basecamp post of required fixes from the professor. Fix your code and edit your original Basecamp post with the words "FINAL TURN IN"

## Rules

* Project must be built with only one valid well-formed HTML file, one css reset file, one user CSS file, and one JavaScript file.

* All source files in UTF-8/Unicode character encoding.

* Do not use any pre-build code or frameworks. Write it all from scratch.

* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files should both be indented with 2 spaces per level of indent; indent all CSS style rules inside the declaring block, and further indent all rules and blocks inside your media queries

* Must pass HTML and CSS validators!

## Requirements

### HTML requirements

1. [x] Only structural, semantic uses of HTML elements and attributes. Absolutely no table markup, break tags, or any other use of HTML to achieve a particular page layout.

2. [ ] At least three HTML form elements, written in conjunction with <label> tags and the for: attribute

3. [x] Semantically structured text-based HTML content to accompany any media elements (image, audio, video) 

### CSS requirements

1. [x] One css file for resetes (Meyers and the Form section of Normalize). A second css file for your unique css code.

2. [x] Use at least two min-width media queries to enhance your mobile-first styles for larger screens

3. [ ] Much of your grade depends on design principles of typography, color, and material design that are discussed in this class. Make sure to demonstrate some grasp of these concepts.

### JavaScript requirements

1. [ ] JavaScript that throws no uncaught errors and is loaded unobtrusively (no JavaScript event attributes in your HTML, in other words; attach events to any elements requiring interaction)

2. [ ] Use the asynchronous attribute to attach JavaScript within your html head

### Git requirements

1. [ ] A Git repository with at least 20 commits and meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect each set of changes that you make

2. [ ] GitHub repository must contain only the files and commits from this project
